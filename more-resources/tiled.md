# Guide to Tiled

**Tiled Editor** is a popular open-source map editor that allows you to create 2D tile-based maps for games and other applications. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of using Tiled Editor to create a simple map

## Step 1: Download and Install Tiled Editor

1. Visit the Tiled Editor website at [https://www.mapeditor.org/](https://www.mapeditor.org/)
2. Download the version of Tiled Editor that matches your operating system (**Windows**, **macOS**, or **Linux**)
3. Install Tiled Editor following the installation instructions for your OS

## Step 2: Create a New Map

1. Open Tiled Editor after installation
2. Click on "File" in the top-left corner and select "**New**"
3. In the "**New Map**" dialog, configure the following settings:
   - **Map Size:** Set the width and height of your map in tiles. For this tutorial, let's use 20x15
   - **Tile Size:** Set the dimensions of each tile in pixels. The default is usually 32x32, which is suitable for most games
   - **Orientation:** Choose "**Orthogonal**" for a basic grid-based map
   - **Render Order:** Leave it as "Right Down" for simplicity
4. Click "**OK**" to create your new map

## Step 3: Add a Tileset

1. In Tiled Editor, a tileset is a collection of tiles that you can use to paint your map
2. Click on "**View**" in the top menu and select "New Tileset" (or press **Ctrl + T**)
3. In the "**New Tileset**" dialog, you can either create a new tileset or import an existing one. For simplicity, let's create a new tileset:
   - Set the "**Tileset Name**" to something meaningful
   - Set the "**Tileset Width**" and "**Tileset Height**" to match your tile size (e.g., 32x32)
4. Click "**OK**" to create the tileset

## Step 4: Paint Your Map

1. On the left side of the Tiled Editor interface, you'll find the "**Tilesets**" window. Select your tileset
2. In the tileset window, click on a tile to select it
3. In the main map window, you can now paint your map by clicking on individual tiles or dragging to paint larger areas
4. Use the "**Layers**" window on the right side to manage different layers of your map. You can create a new layer for objects, terrain, and more

## Step 5: Save Your Map

1. To save your map, click "File" in the top-left corner and select "Save" (or press **Ctrl + S**)
2. Choose a location on your computer to save the map file (it will have a **.tmx** extension)

## Step 6: Export Your Map

1. If you plan to use your map in a game or application, you'll need to export it in a compatible format
2. Click "**File**" and select "Export" to choose an export format (common formats include **JSON**, **XML**, or **image**)
3. Follow the prompts to configure the export settings and save the file
