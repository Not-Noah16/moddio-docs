# Overview

Triggers the script when the owner of a game has already sent out too many Modd Coins that day.

## How it works

Game owners who are sending out coins can set a maximium limit to how many coins can be sent out each real life day. Every day, this number resets. All Modd Coins sent out by the game will contribute to this limit, and when it is reached this script will trigger when coins are attempted to be given to a player.
