Game templates allow you to start making your new game, but not completely from scratch. Modd.io currently has 14 game templates, 13 excluding the blank template. Each template has code, art, scripts, and more that make it unique.

Some game templates have been reworked. You can tell if a template was reworked if it has "(Advanced)" in its name.
